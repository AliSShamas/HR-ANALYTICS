# HR-ANALYTICS

In this Human Resources analytics project, I leveraged the power of Tableau and Power BI to analyze employee data, identify key trends, and provide actionable insights to support HR strategies and decision-making.

The primary goal was to gain a thorough understanding of workforce trends, performance, and engagement. To accomplish this, I cleaned and imported the Excel data into Tableau and Power BI, where I developed dynamic dashboards to summarize the key findings.
